Vessel simulator used in master project and master thesis of M. Kongshaug, H. Mo, E. Midtun and J. Hygen. The project is developed at Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Institue of Marine Technology.

The python package is not complete and there is no guarantee for the validity of the vessel models.

The complete documentation can be found at: https://wave-model.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html

## How to use mclsimpy

### Disclaimer

This is a cleaned-up version of a previous master's work, called MCSimPython, into a new package called mclsimpy to streamline our development efforts on digital twin and developing high fidelity simulation models for Cybership Vessels. The package can be found here
